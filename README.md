# CSI 5139 Assignment 3

This assignment explores transfer learning, as well as multi-task learning. We use Keras with the tensorï¬‚ow backend. We train a VGG16 model on a classification task of 68 textures, as well as train a MobileNetV2 model on a classification task of 12 birds.

## Jupyter Notebook and Python

This homework makes use of [jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/) written in python.
